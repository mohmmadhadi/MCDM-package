\title{Implementation of MULTIMOORA Method for Multi-Criteria Decision Making Problems.}
\usage{
MMOORA(decision, weights, cb)
}
\arguments{
\item{decision}{The decision matrix (\emph{m} x \emph{n}) with the values of the \emph{m} alternatives, for the \emph{n} criteria.}

\item{weights}{A vector of length \emph{n}, containing the weights for the criteria. The sum of the weights has to be 1.}

\item{cb}{A vector of length \emph{n}. Each component is either \code{cb(i)='max'} if the \emph{i-th} criterion is benefit or \code{cb(i)='min'} if the \emph{i-th} criterion is a cost.}
}
\value{
\code{MMOORA} returns a data frame which contains the scores and the four rankings calculated (Ratio System, Reference Point, Multiplicative Form and Multi-MOORA ranking).
}
\description{
The \code{MMOORA} function implements both the Multi-Objetive Optimization by Ration Analysis (MOORA) and the "Full Multiplicative Form" (MULTIMOORA).
